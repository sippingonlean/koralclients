ur file needs to be a rbxl format 3 (basically an rbxl from 2016 studio)
 
rbxls from 2018 and onwards are rbxl format 27, so everything (client, studio, rcc) from 2016 cannot read the file
 
to make your rbxl a "rbxl format 3" follow these steps (or to keep colors while importing your place):
open your place in modern studio (like 2023 studio) and run (paste the script in the command bar) the contents of colorfixMODERNside.lua
close it and save it to the roblox xml format (rbxlx)
open it up in our 2016, Koral studio client
run the contents of colorfix2016side.lua
save to rbxl
